# Speed Tiers

This is a work in progress to help identify all possible speed tiers in a format.

## TODO

* Toggle more conditions 
    * Speed Stages.
        * Speed Boost ability -- how many turns?
        * Room Service activated
        * Booster Energy (not relevant in H so this can be deferred)
* Nearby thresholds only
    * All of the current threshold
    * Increase threshold until X met
* Support more regulations
