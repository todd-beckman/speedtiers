# Speed Tiers

This is a work in progress to help identify all possible speed tiers in a format.

## TODO

* Toggle more conditions 
* Provide stats
* Nearby thresholds only
    * All of the current threshold
    * Increase threshold until X met
* Trick Room? 
    * Sort Descending?
* Relevant mons vs all of the mons
    * Forms with the same speed
    * How much of this can be automated
        * Maybe the NFE's are whitelisted
        * Just keep all FE's
